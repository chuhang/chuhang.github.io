    	<h2>The "Constellation Graph" of Computer Vision Research in US Universities</h2>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
		<p>In the December of 2015, I will be applying for PhD in computer vision. I wondered which university has made the most influence to computer vision research, so I did this little study.</p>
		
		<h3>The graph</h3>
		<p>Let's cut to the chase, here is the what the graph looks like:<br>
		<center><img src="images/constellation.png" alt="constellation" style="width:600px;height:600px"></center>
		</p>
		
		<h3>How I made it</h3>
		<p>Okay, so here's how I made it.</p>
		<p><b>Universities:</b> I took the union of top 20 US universities in the 2015 US News World Rank in CS, and the 2014 US News US University Rank in Artificial Intelligence, resulted in 24 universities. (Yes the US News Rank is nonsense, but this covers most major ones.)<br>
		<b>Professors:</b> My study was purely professor-based. I collected biographies of all 97 computer vision-related professors in those 24 universities, and recorded where they did college, master (if not same as PhD), PhD, and post-doc.<br>
		<b>Edges:</b> The strength of edge A to B between two universities suggests the number of professors in B, who have studied in A (I counted post-doc also as part of studying).<br>
		<b>Node sizes:</b> One node corresponds to one university, its size is determined by the total out degree of all its edges. The larger a node is, the more professors who have studied there.		
		</p>
		
		<h3>Some interesting observations</h3>
		<p>
		1. The strongest edge is <b>{MIT -> MIT = 8}</b>, indicating 8 MIT vision professors have studied in MIT. The second to fourth strongest edges are <b>{CMU -> CMU = 5}</b>, <b>{MIT -> GaTech = 4}</b>, and <b>{CMU -> GaTech = 4}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		2. The largest node is <b>{MIT = 34}</b>, indicating 34 vision professors have studied in MIT. The second to fourth largest nodes are <b>{Stanford = 26}</b>, <b>{UCB = 19}</b>, and <b>{CMU = 15}</b>. (The Top Four!)
		</p>
		<p>
		3. 17 universities have vision professors who studied at MIT, same applies to Stanford. The third and fourth are UCB (13 universities) and CalTech (11 universities). 
		</p>
		<p>
		4. Zero Stanford vision professor did PhD at MIT, also zero MIT vision professor did PhD at Stanford <b>{Stanford <-phd-> MIT =0}</b>. Same applies to <b>{MIT <-phd-> CMU = 0}</b> and <b>{Stanford <-phd-> CMU = 0}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		5. The strongest self loop is <b>{loop(MIT) = 8}</b>. The second to fourth are <b>{loop(CMU) = 5}</b>, <b>{loop(UWash) = 3}</b>, and <b>{loop(Purdue) = 2}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		6. Consider a world of four factions, with MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and CMU being the fixed fraction member. Now we divide this constellation graph into this four factions, using the edge strength as evidence of academic bound to each faction, and also taking into account the geological distance when equal edge strengths occur. Here's what I've got:<br>
		<b>The MIT faction:</b> Harvard, UT-Austin, UCLA, UMich, UMD, Cornell, UMass, Yale. (9)<br>
		<b>The Stanford faction:</b> Princeton, UCSD, USC, UWash, UWisc. (6)<br>
		<b>The UCB faction:</b> UCI, CalTech, UPenn. (4)<br>
		<b>The CMU faction:</b> GaTech, UIUC, Columbia. (4)<br>
		and Purdue on its own.
